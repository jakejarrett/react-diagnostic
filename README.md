# react-diagnostic

Diagnostic tooling to help with debugging react apps

## What should this do?

It should provide the ability to scan the entire dom, get a list of the fiber instances & it will _TRY_ to get both props & state.

Useful for debugging state bugs or a self-report bug system that sends up the app state at the time of the bug.
